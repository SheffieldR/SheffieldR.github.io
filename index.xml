<figcaption>Schematic showing the interaction between the company API (application programming interface) and the consultant automated workflow.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Requiring access to sensitive data can be a significant obstacle for the development of health models in the Health Economics &amp; Outcomes Research (HEOR) setting. We demonstrate how health economic evaluation can be conducted with minimal transfer of data between parties, while automating reporting as new information becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: We developed an automated analysis and reporting pipeline for health economic modelling and made the source code openly available on a GitHub repository. The pipeline consists of three parts: An economic model is constructed by the consultant using pseudo data. On the data-owner side, an application programming interface (API) is hosted on a server. This API hosts all sensitive data, so that data does not have to be provided to the consultant. An automated workflow is created, which calls the API, retrieves results, and generates a report.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> : The application of modern data science tools and practices allows analyses of data without the need for direct access – negating the need to send sensitive data. In addition, the entire workflow can be largely automated: the analysis can be scheduled to run at defined time points (e.g.&nbsp;monthly), or when triggered by an event (e.g.&nbsp;an update to the underlying data or model code); results can be generated automatically and then be exported into a report. Documents no longer need to be revised manually.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>: This example demonstrates that it is possible, within a HEOR setting, to separate the health economic model from the data, and automate the main steps of the analysis pipeline.</p>

<figcaption>Schematic of a typical model structure taking raw data and user inputs and using a set of functions to return results in the form of data, publication tables, and figures.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: The use of programming languages such as R in health economics and decision science is increasing, and brings numerous benefits including increasing model development efficiency, improving transparency, and reducing human error. However, there is limited guidance on how to best develop models using R. So far, no clear consensus has emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong>: We present the advantages of creating health economic models as R packages - structured collections of functions, data sets, tests, and documentation. Assuming an intermediate understanding of R, we provide a tutorial to demonstrate how to construct a basic R package for health economic evaluation. All source code used in or referenced by this paper is available under an open-source licence.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study</strong>: We use the Sick Sicker Model as a case study applying the steps from the tutorial to standardise model development, documentation and aid review. This can improve the distribution of code, thereby streamlining model development, and improving methods in health economic evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: R packages offer a valuable framework for enhancing the quality and transparency of health economic evaluation models. Embracing better, more standardised software development practices, while fostering a collaborative culture, has the potential to significantly improve the quality of health economic models, and, ultimately, support better decision making in healthcare.</p>

<p>Join us for an exciting showcase where we’ll dive into two innovative R-Shiny projects. The first project introduces the fascinating world of mapping to investigate the dynamics of segregation among neighboring regions, a concept we fondly refer to as “social frontiers.” In the second project, we explore economic sectors with a focus on aiding South Yorkshire’s mayoral authority in their strategic growth planning endeavours.</p>
<p>The burning question that currently occupies our minds: How can we leverage powerful tools like Shiny to assist other institutions, including local councils and mayoral offices, in streamlining their data analysis processes and preventing unnecessary duplication of effort? Be a part of this engaging exploration and discover how Shiny can be a game-changer in data analysis for various institutions. Don’t miss this opportunity to be part of the conversation and gain valuable insights into the future of data-driven decision-making.</p>

  <title>rrtools: Tools for Writing Reproducible Research in R</title>
  <link>https://SheffieldR.github.io/posts/2018-04-10-apr-meetup/2018-04-10-apr-meetup.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>NOTE: Because of the Easter holidays April’s meetup will be on the 2nd Tue of the month.</em></p>
<p>This month we’ll be exploring <strong>rrtools</strong>, an implementation of R package structure, development tools and practices to a research workflow context.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rrtools builds on functionality offered by packages like devtools and usethis, adapting and extending them to a research context. The package provides guidance, templates, and functions for making a basic compendium suitable for doing reproducible research with R and a convenient starting point for writing a journal article, report, or thesis.</p>
<p><em>Useful features:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A template for doing scholarly writing in a literate programming environment using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/home/about.html">bookdown</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Isolation of your computational environment in a container using <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a></p></li>
<li><p>Package dependency versioning using <a href="https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility/">MRAN</a>,</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Integration (testing) using <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners">Travis</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this joint session, Anna Krystalli will give an overview of the philosophy, key functions and resulting compendium structure while Dan Olner will walk us through using the tools to convert an existing research project to a reproducible research compendium.</p>

  <title>Stan and the Tidyverse</title>
  <link>https://SheffieldR.github.io/posts/2018-02-06-feb-meetup/2018-02-06-feb-meetup.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Welcome back to the Sheffield R Meetup! We’re kicking off 2018 with two great talks:</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Shaun Coutts will be giving a demonstration of using Stan via the <a href="https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan">rstan</a> interface and launching jobs on iceberg and sharc.</p>
<p>Katjuša Koler will be talking about doing things differently using the Tidyverse:</p>
<p>In this session, I will give an example of a workflow in base R and compare it to a tidyverse approach. Tidyverse is a system of packages (dplyr, ggplot2 etc.) used to manipulate, explore and visualize data. I will discuss the pros and cons of each workflow. This talk will be useful for beginners, as well as anyone considering making a bridge from base R to tidyverse.</p>
<p>So two talks, one with Bayes R and one with Base R! We look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>It’s <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> over on GitHub! a global celebration of open source intended to promote participation in open source projects.</p>
<p>So this month we’re taking a break from talks and booked some group hackspaces at the University throughout the month to <strong>get involved in some open source projects requiring some #rstats help.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can benefit from getting involved, regardless of coding skill. At the very least, you’ll <strong>learn more about open source</strong> and <strong>how to contribute through online collaborative coding platforms like GitHub</strong>. But you never know, you might end up stumbling across the perfect project for you and ending up joining a community.</p>
<p>You can choose to contribute as little or much as you like, from correcting typos, contributing ideas to discussions to building features! Make at least 4 contributions (pull requests) to any GitHub-hosted project between October 1 and October 31 to <strong>earn a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt!</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="welcome-back-to-a-new-season-of-r-user-group-meetups">Welcome back to a new season of R user group meetups</h2>
<p>We’ve got an exciting pair of talks for you this month!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First up, <strong>Chris Hopkinson</strong>, self-described Data Lover, will be talking us through <strong>Object oriented systems in R</strong>:</p>
<p><em>“Object Oriented programming is commonplace in many languages. It is a useful way to organise code. R has some special flavours of Object Oriented programming. Understanding these will help you understand R better and write better software.”</em></p>
<p>Then, we have <strong>Phil Mike Jones</strong>, a geographer about to complete his PhD in computational human geography + a research associate at the Centre for Criminological Research at the School of Law,who will be discussing his journey in writing a <strong>Reproducible Thesis with Bookdown</strong>.</p>
<p><em>“My PhD thesis is completely reproducible (except a few items that cannot be downloaded without website credentials) and this has saved me no end of headaches now I’m preparing to submit. Supervisor (or boss) asked for some changes? No problem: change the data, run the code, and sit back as all figures and calculations are automatically updated. I probably don’t need to remind you that reproducibility is also the hallmark of the scientific method.</em></p>
<p><em>In this session, I’ll share some tips that I discovered along the way and hopefully, at least some will be helpful for your projects. A completely reproducible project might not be possible or practical for you, but reproducibility is a scale so all projects could benefit from at least some of this advice.”</em></p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>

  <title>July Sheffield R Meetup: Thermal images and Object oriented systems in R</title>
  <link>https://SheffieldR.github.io/posts/2017-07-04-july-meetup/2017-07-04-july-meetup.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We’ve got two great talks lined up for our last meeting before the summer break.</p>
<p><em>Update: Due to a change in availability we have had to postpone the talk on object oriented systems in R. Instead we’ll be holding an informal code clinic, so come along with any coding problems that you want to discuss.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Senior</strong> is a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield, and avid lover of using R to do just about everything! She studies interactions between land-use change and climate change in the tropics. She’s going to talk about the work she’s been doing analysing thermal image data collected in the forests of Borneo.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Hopkinson</strong> is a Sheffield R group regular, analyst and data lover. He’ll be giving us the low-down on object oriented systems in R.</p>
<!--more-->
<section id="thermal-images-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thermal-images-in-r">Thermal images in R</h2>
<p>Rebecca will introduce the ThermImage package and demonstrate its use in extracting and processing thermal images in R. She’ll talk about the challenges associated with the structure of thermal data and the kinds of questions that ecologists can ask with such data, such as capturing the extent to which animals can move locally to track their preferred temperatures. A single thermal image produces 19,200 distinct temperature measurements, so optimising the extraction -&gt; processing -&gt; plotting -&gt; analysis workflow is essential.</p>

  <title>June Sheffield R Meetup: Literate programming and Writing a decision tree package for R</title>
  <link>https://SheffieldR.github.io/posts/2017-06-06-june-meetup/2017-06-06-june-meetup.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This month Anna Krystalli will present a exploration of literate programming, following up from a discussion on literate programming techniques at our meetup in April, and Pete Dodd will tell us about building an open source decision tree package in R.</p>
<section id="literate-programming-with-rmarkdown" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="literate-programming-with-rmarkdown">Literate programming with Rmarkdown</h2>
<p>In this session we’ll explore the various options and strategies for literate programming and dynamic report generation in R and Rmarkdown. This session will make use of the literate programming packages knitr and Rmarkdown.</p>

<section id="writing-a-decision-tree-package-for-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-a-decision-tree-package-for-r">Writing a decision tree package for R</h2>
<p>Decision trees are a class of model widely used in health economic modelling. A tree (in the mathematical sense) has probabilities associated with branches leaving a node to describe the chances of a set of potential outcomes. In health economics, costs and health consequences are also associated with outcomes. By way of example, clinical diagnostic algorithms based on a sequence of symptom screens and diagnostic tests map particularly naturally into this framework. There are proprietary packages to develop, visualize and analyse such models, but nothing open-source and user-friendly. We describe an attempt to develop a package with a simple syntax for decision tree models in R based on the DOT language, which allows visualization, as well as considerable flexibility in analysis approach.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>

  <title>May Sheffield R Meetup: Making R Faster</title>
  <link>https://SheffieldR.github.io/posts/2017-05-02-may-meetup/2017-05-02-may-meetup.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This month we’ll be learning from Théo Michelot how to make R go faster using a couple of techniques.</p>
<section id="using-c-to-speed-up-r-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-c-to-speed-up-r-code">Using C++ to speed up R code</h2>
<p>R is a very handy tool for data analysis, but it can be computationally quite slow. When analysing large data sets, or using complex models, it can be desirable to speed things up. For this reason, it has become increasingly common to combine R code with C++ code. C++ is a compiled programming language, which makes it much faster than R in some cases. I will first talk about Rcpp, an R package which makes it very simple to call C++ functions from an R script. Then, I will talk about the Template Model Builder (TMB), an R package which uses automatic differentiation in C++ to speed up the numerical evaluation of a function (typically, a likelihood function), thus making techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation very fast. I will show that these do not require a strong programming background, and that it is quite easy for someone familiar with R to use Rcpp and TMB. I will compare the three approaches with examples of code.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>

  <title>February Sheffield R Meetup: Martin Garlovsky and Christopher Hopkinson</title>
  <link>https://SheffieldR.github.io/posts/2017-02-01-february-meetup/2017-02-01-february-meetup.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In this month’s meeting we’ll explore survival analysis, a means of analysing data in which the outcome is the time to the occurrence of an event of interest. We’ll also be finding out about one of the more esoteric features of the R language, namely non-standard evaluation.</p>
<section id="survival-analysis-with-coxme" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="survival-analysis-with-coxme">Survival analysis with coxme</h2>
<p>Martin Garlovsky, a PhD student studying sexual selection and speciation, will talk about using Cox proportional hazards models with random effects to perform survival analysis. Survival analysis can be used for a wide range of “time to event” data, e.g.&nbsp;deaths, divorce, maturation, relapse, disease etc, and is applicable in a wide range of biological, medical and social research. The R packages coxme, coxph and survival provide methods for survival analysis.</p>

<section id="non-standard-evaluation-or-why-r-is-a-little-unusual" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="non-standard-evaluation-or-why-r-is-a-little-unusual">Non-Standard Evaluation, or why R is a little unusual</h2>
<p>Analyst and data lover, Christopher Hopkinson, will be delving into the bowels of the R language to try to understand how R evaluates our code and when this may lead to unexpected results.</p>
<p>If this topic is of interest, you might like to have a read of <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html">Hadley’s Advanced R book</a>.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the Red Deer on 7 February! Location details are on our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SheffieldR-Sheffield-R-Users-Group/events/237310112//">meetup event</a>.</p>
