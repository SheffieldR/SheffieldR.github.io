We are Sheffield R-ladies, a chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/). The mission of R-Ladies is to achieve
proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently under-represented in
the R community. R-Ladiesâ€™ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their
programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to
facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.

We meet roughly every 3 months to learn about and discuss R. If you would like to volunteer to talk at an event or have
an idea for future meet ups, please [get in touch!](mailto:sheffield@rladies.org)

Meetings are advertised on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sheffield/).
