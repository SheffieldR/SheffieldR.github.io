Steps to take when setting up a new meeting. Ideally setup and announcements should be made at least two weeks in
advance. The longer the notification period the more likely it is that people will be able to attend.

## Setup

      portal](https://staff.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/room-bookings/process), ensuring that it is accessible to the public, i.e., without requiring a UofS ID card.
+ [ ] **Request details from speaker 1** : Request a summary of the talk and a speaker biography from speaker 1.

      instructions) with details of the talk(s) and speaker(s) biographies. Include both the Google Meet and Calendar Link in the web-page.

## Announcements

Announcements of forthcoming events can be made in a number of places, at a bare minimum the _Meetup Mailing List_
should be used as it is the primary source for organising the group. These should be made at least two weeks in advance
to maximise the notification period and increase attendance but reminders can be sent out closer to the time if required
(e.g. to the Meetup Mailing List).

+ [ ] **Meetup Mailing List** : Announce the meeting on the [Meetup SheffieldR User Group](https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/) mailing list including both the Google Meet and Calendar links.

+ [ ] **University Website - What's On** : Submit [a form]( https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/whatson/submit ) with details of the event to announce on the University's What's on public page. This should be done at least two weeks in advance.
+ [ ] **NHS-R Slack** : If you are a member you can announce the event on the [NHS-R
      Slack](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/).
