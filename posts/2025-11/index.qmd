Most of the year has passed without much activity but we are pleased to announce that Dr Robert Smith and Oliver Dolin
have volunteered to talk about their development of a web platform for healthcare professionals.

## Where and When

Meeting will be held 2025-11-19 17:30-19:00 in Lecture Theatre 8 of [The Diamond][diamond].

Sign up via [Meetup][meetup] although remote attendance is possible via [Google Meet][googlemeet].

## Abstract

Access to healthcare-professional administered medicines in England varies significantly across the country, resulting
in inequitable health outcomes. Our interactive web platform identifies optimal new care site locations. It uses a
greedy search method outlined in Schneider & Smith (2020) to rank candidate sites that maximize a range of user-selected
objective functions such as: travel distance, travel time, adherence or health outcomes. Users can customize input
parameters like travel cost and CO<sub>2</sub>/km, and estimate the impact of adding new sites on a range of outcomes
including
patient travel time, adherence, health outcomes, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and out-of-pocket costs. The platform uses
data on the
socioeconomic  and demographic structure of each Lower Super Output Area, a small community of around 1500 individuals,
in England. It combines this with information on the prevalence of disease, and the relationship between geographic
access and outcomes. It allows users to assess the impact of creating one or more of the sites identified on national
and regional outcomes, and to assess the impact on inequalities. The platform is in beta stage, and we are interested in
feedback from the research community on how to build upon this work going forward.
