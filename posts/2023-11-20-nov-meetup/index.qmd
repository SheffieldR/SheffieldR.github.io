After October's Reboot, we are back with another Meetup this 20th November for a showcase using Shiny to illuminate the
power of data-driven insights. Join us as we delve into the world of interactive data visualization, with hands-on
demonstrations, insightful discussions, and practical use cases that will empower you to harness the potential of Shiny
in your own projects.

Meeting is 2023-11-20 17:30-19:00 in 107 Workroom 4, 38 Mappin Street. Sign up

## Summary

![](image.png)

Join us for an exciting showcase where we'll dive into two innovative R-Shiny projects. The first project introduces the
fascinating world of mapping to investigate the dynamics of segregation among neighboring regions, a concept we fondly
refer to as "social frontiers." In the second project, we explore economic sectors with a focus on aiding South
Yorkshire's mayoral authority in their strategic growth planning endeavours.

The burning question that currently occupies our minds: How can we leverage powerful tools like Shiny to assist other
institutions, including local councils and mayoral offices, in streamlining their data analysis processes and preventing
unnecessary duplication of effort? Be a part of this engaging exploration and discover how Shiny can be a game-changer
in data analysis for various institutions. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of the conversation and gain valuable
insights into the future of data-driven decision-making.
