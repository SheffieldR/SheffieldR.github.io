After a long hiatus SheffieldR User Group is back and we'll be starting things off by looking at the new document
preparation system [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and how to use it with GitHub to publish presentations as
websites. There is however still scope for a second talk so if you'd like to make a short presentation on how you have
used R in your research please [get in touch](mailto:n.shephard@sheffield.ac.uk).

Meeting is 2023-10-26 17:30-19:00 in LT02 (60), Arts Tower, Western Bank, Sheffield. Sign up
[here](https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/events/296493587/).

## Quarto for RevealJS Slides

The evolution of literate programming continues with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) which builds on the widely popular
[RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). Powered by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) under the hood it continues
to provide many popular document structures such as books, journal articles, Beamer articles and websites, but extends
these further introducing new document structures such as blogs including [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com) slide
presentations. Further support is now available for more programming languages beyond R including
[Python](https://python.org), [Julia](https://julialang.org) and the JavaScript data analysis language
[Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-javascript).

[Neil Shephard](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/research-staff/neil-shephard) is a Research Software Engineer
within the Department of Computer Science, will guide you through how to use a GitHub Template for Quarto RevealJS slides
to create and publish them to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
