We kick off this semester's Sheffield R User Group meetings in October with a series of hackathons to participate in
[Hacktoberfest 2024][hack24].

![Hacktoberfest 2024](img/DO-HFest-EmailBanner-600px-2-@2x.png)

Hacktoberfest is an annual "_month-long celebration of all things open-source_" that runs across [GitHub][gh] and
[GitLab][gl] which "_welcome[s] anyone who is interested in diving in, and everyone who's already part of the open-source
software community._".

We have planned four meetings across the month of October to help and support each other in contributing to open-source
projects related to the [R][r] language and ecosystem including [rOpenSci][ropensci] and
[Bioconductor][bioconductor]. In the first session on Friday 2024-10-04 we will go over the basics of Git and contributing
via [GitHub][gh]/[GitLab][gl] to open-source projects and how to go about finding R projects with issues that you could
tackle and solve as part of Hacktoberfest 2024.

The remaining sessions will be held weekly on Fridays at lunch time from 12:30-13:30 in the University of Sheffield's
Students Union. During these sessions you can come along and seek support and offer help to those who have questions, whether that is with some
aspect of R, documentation, continuous integration, linting, tests or anything you have been working on as part of
Hacktoberfest.
