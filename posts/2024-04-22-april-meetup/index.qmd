Join us for the April edition of SheffieldR User Group, where we continue to explore the exciting world of R programming
and its applications. This month, we're thrilled to feature two insightful talks from experts in the field.

Our first speaker, Daniel Brady, will delve into the intricacies of profiling and code optimization in R. Discover how
to streamline your code for improved efficiency and performance, as Dan shares practical tips and techniques to enhance
your programming skills.

Following Dan's presentation, we'll hear from Joe Heffer, who will introduce us to strategies used in R while
implementing a pipeline. Dive into the world of health data as Joe walks us through packaging, ensuring data integrity,
and handling sensitive data securely through the development and implementation of a pipeline.

Meeting is 2024-04-22 12:00-1:30 in [Regent Court](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/16201517), John Pemberton LT B
(40). Sign up [here](https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/events/300164087/). Remote attendance is
possible using [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/xka-dxah-sqf).

If you have any questions or enquiries please email us [sheffieldr\@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk).

## Profiling and optimising your R code

![Profiling](image.png)

Nobody likes slow code, luckily most programming languages provide you with tools to help you analyse and enhance
your code’s performance and R is no exception.

In this session we’ll cover some of the tools and strategies available in the R ecosystem to optimise your code. We’ll
start by giving a brief introduction to profiling, and then we’ll use the
[`{profvis}`](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/) to profile some code to determine which parts are taking up the most
execution time. Then we’ll move on to discuss potential strategies that reduce execution time, and we’ll use the
[`{bench}`](https://bench.r-lib.org/) to compare these different strategies against one another to find the best
performing solution.


### Biography - Daniel Brady

[Dr Daniel Brady](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/contact/dan-brady/) is a Research Software Engineer in the RSE team at the
University of Sheffield. His background is in Cognitive Neuroscience, completing his PhD at Goldsmiths in 2016. Since
then he has worked as a Research Fellow at Birkbeck and the University of Surrey and as Research Technician at the
University of Reading. He has experience of writing research software and analysis pipelines using R, Python and
Julia. He is also a keen advocate of open and reproducible research practices.

## R Strategies for Health Data Pipelines

In this session, we delve into the intricate world of health data. Our discussion encompasses crucial aspects such as
data packaging, ensuring data integrity, and handling sensitive health data securely.

Navigating the complexities of health data, we address the challenges associated with the arrival of unforeseen data
volumes. With a focus on scalability, we examine techniques to handle unexpectedly large data sets using packages like
[`{arrow}`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) and [`{DuckDB}`](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r.html) and
[`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

### Biography - Joe Heffer

Dr Joe Heffer is a Research Data Engineer at the University of Sheffield where he has worked on various project across
the University. He actively assists researchers in leveraging data engineering techniques to uncover insights and drive
impactful research outcomes. Additionally, Joe advocates for best practices and fosters an open community of
collaboration among researchers and data professionals.
