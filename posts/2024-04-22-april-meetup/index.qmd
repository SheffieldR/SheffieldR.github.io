Join us for the April edition of SheffieldR User Group, where we continue to explore the exciting world of R programming and its applications. This month, we're thrilled to feature two insightful talks from experts in the field.

Our first speaker, Dan from RSE, will delve into the intricacies of profiling and code optimization in R. Discover how to streamline your code for improved efficiency and performance, as Dan shares practical tips and techniques to enhance your programming skills.

Following Dan's presentation, we'll hear from Joe from IT services, who will introduce us to 'Cured,' a data pipeline in R. Dive into the world of data processing and manipulation as Joe walks us through the development and implementation of the pipeline.


Meeting is 2024-04-22 12:00-1:30 in [Regent Court](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/16201517), John Pemberton LT B (40).
