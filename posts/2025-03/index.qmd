We've been a bit quiet recently but are back with our first meetup of 2025 on 13th March where we welcome [Dr Neil
Lawrence][neil] and [Charlotte Head][charlotte] from the University of Sheffield School of Medicine and Population
Health.

## Where and When

Meeting will be held 2025-03-13 12:30-13:30 in Room 315 of [The Diamond][diamond].

Sign up via [Meetup][meetup] although remote attendance is possible via [Google Meet][googlemeet].

## Charlotte Head - `{devtools}`

Want to make your R life easier? This talk introduces how to build R packages (it's much easier than you think!) and how
they can organise your code. Using [`devtools`][devtools], we'll build a simple package (by getting some ASCII animals
to compliment you using the R packages `praise` and `cowsay`!). We'll be covering the essentials: structure, functions,
and documentation. By the end, you'll be ready to create your own packages. Bring your laptop if you'd like to follow
along (the download prerequisites for codealongs are the `devtools`, `praise` and `cowsay` packages, as well as Rtools
(Windows) or XCode (Mac)).

### Bio

Charlotte is a Research Associate in Public Health Economic Modelling working on the [Local Health and Global Profits
project][localhealth] since September 2024. Beginning with a Biomedical Science degree at Sheffield Hallam University
and spending some time working with the Clinical Microbiology team at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, she then moved on to
the University of York for postgraduate research in Antimicrobial Resistance where she found a love for coding in R and
big data. She has a strong interest in public health and data science, especially the use of big data to inform health
decision-making and the implementation of One-Health policies and commercial determinants of health. Charlotte is
currently working on generating local synthetic populations using the Health Survey for England for use in public health
policy and is open to suggestions for how best to validate these at low geographies.

## Neil Lawrence - SITAR : Longitudinal multilevel modelling

Super Imposition by Translation And Rotation (SITAR) is an advanced statistical modelling that uses longitudinal
multilevel modelling to appropriately summarise time series data, particularly useful for modelling the growth of
children. Advantages include application to data that is measured at variable frequencies, as well as relatively simple
model fit statistics that help the selection of hyperparameters and the avoidance of overfitting. However, the use of
terms such as 'random effects', akin to terms like 'missing at random' when considering challenges around missing data,
create barriers when explaining these models to clinicians. Technical challenges such as the impact of time varying
covariates also make robust estimation of the impact of treatment changes within patients difficult to define. This talk
will show the application of SITAR modelling to cohort and registry data and some of the insights that have been gained,
and hopefully inspire conversation about how such modelling can move from being purely descriptive, to predictive and
suitable to be incorporated into clinical decision support tools on the front line of clinical practice.

### Bio

Neil is an NIHR doctoral research fellow in paediatrics and child health, and clinically works as a paediatric
registrar. Originally having studied Civil Engineering, Neil completed a degree in medicine and then the NIHR academic
foundation programme. He completed the National Medical Director's Clinical Fellow Scheme working for NHS Digital within
the Data, Insights & Statistics division, where he developed his interest in data analytics using R. He is working to
gain insights from real world data within the International Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Registry, amongst other data
sets including those related to COVID-19, as well as cohort data from the neonatal unit at Jessops Wing. Neil is keen to
develop his interest in clinical decision support tools, and is always happy to hear suggestions about how to best
explain findings from statistical models to other clinicians, as well as effective ways to incorporate statistical
modelling within software as a medical device in an explainable and transparent fashion.
