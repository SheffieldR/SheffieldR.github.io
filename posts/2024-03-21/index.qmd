This March meetup see's a slight deviation from the normal format of the SheffieldR meetups as we are inviting you to
bring your data, code, R knowledge and enthusiasm along to help each other out in a "Hackathon" style meeting.

Meeting is 2024-03-21 17:30-19:00 in the [Portobello Centre](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/174114141), Seminar Room
C02 B (just off Mappin Street). Sign up is via
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldr-sheffield-r-users-group/events/299525846/). Unfortunately we won't be running remote attendance this time because of the nature of
the meeting.

If you have any questions or enquiries please email us [sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk).

Maybe you've a problem using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage your packages or you're
stuck with a particular data wrangling problem or haven't worked out the perfect layout of your graph then bring your
data and code along and see if there is someone who can help you solve your problem. Whether that is using the
[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/),
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) or base graphics.

Obviously we'll need people with experience to come and help others solve their problems, but even if you're just
starting out on your R journey you will know something to contribute.

If you'd like to come along we've setup a short
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffiI7o68QcFngrirJ7YrjGgJfduwtv0UWJDQeNQLLKUDQmzA/viewform?pli=1) for
you to indicate what areas you are looking for assistance with or can help others with.

## Reprex

Its possible that the section of code you are having trouble with is part of a larger workflow. To make it easier for
people to understand the problem and offer assistance it would be beneficial if you are able to abstract out the problem
to what is know as a Minimal "_Reproducible Example_" often shortened to the portmanteau "_reprex_". There is advice on
[How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) on Stack
Overflow and there is also the R package [{reprex}](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) which helps "_prepare reproducible
example code via the clipboard_".

## Data Security and Sensitivity

If your problem involves sensitive data then please be mindful of this. See the University of Sheffield [Information
Security Training](https://infosecurity.shef.ac.uk/training_courses/online/protecting-research-data) pages, in
particular the training on _Protecting Research Data_, _Protecting Personal Data_ and _Protecting Information_. If you
are not a student or member of staff at The University of Sheffield please refer to your institution or employers
guidelines on data security.
