This month, we're shaking things up with an exciting line-up of lightning talks presented by you, our vibrant community members! This is your chance to share your knowledge, showcase your projects, and discuss your favourite R topics in a quick, 5-10 minute format.

If you have a fascinating R project you're working on, a useful package you can't live without, or a data analysis technique you think others should know about sign up to present a lightning talk and share it with the SheffieldR community!

Whether you're a seasoned R user or just starting out, we encourage everyone to participate. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn from each other, exchange ideas, and inspire fellow R enthusiasts.
