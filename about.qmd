We are the SheffieldR User group. We meet roughly every month to learn about and discuss R. We aim to provide a friendly
and welcoming space for Sheffield R users of any level of R skill.

Meetings are advertised on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/SheffieldR-Sheffield-R-Users-Group/) and if you would
like to volunteer to talk at a meeting you are more than welcome, please get in touch with
[sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk).

Slides and other material from our meetups are available on our GitHub account [SheffieldR](https://github.com/SheffieldR/).
