We are the Sheffield R group. We meet used to meet every month or so  to learn about and discuss R over a drink or two,
the pandemic threw a spanner in the works of that but we're looking to get meetings back up and running with some degree
of regularity.

Meetings are advertised on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/SheffieldR-Sheffield-R-Users-Group/)

Slides and other material from our meetups is available here.
