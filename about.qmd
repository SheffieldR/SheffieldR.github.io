We are the SheffieldR User group. We meet roughly every month or so to learn from each other and discuss R. We aim to
provide a friendly and welcoming space for Sheffield R users of any level of R skill.

Meetings are advertised on our [Meetup page][meetup], we have a (sleepy) [Slack Channel][slack] and if you would like to
volunteer to talk at a meeting you are more than welcome, please get in touch with [sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:sheffieldr@sheffield.ac.uk).

Slides and other material from our meetups are available on our GitHub account [SheffieldR][github].
