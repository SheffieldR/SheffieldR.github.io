We are the Sheffield R group. We meet roughly every month to learn about and discuss R, the pandemic threw a spanner in
the works of that but we're looking to get meetings back up and running with some degree of regularity.

Meetings are advertised on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/SheffieldR-Sheffield-R-Users-Group/)

Slides and other material from our meetups is available on our GitHub account [SheffieldR](https://github.com/SheffieldR/).
