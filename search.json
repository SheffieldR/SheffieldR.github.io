At the very least, you’ll learn more about open source and how to contribute through online collaborative coding platforms like GitHub. But you never know, you might end up stumbling across the perfect project for you and ending up joining a community.\nYou can choose to contribute as little or much as you like, from correcting typos, contributing ideas to discussions to building features! Make at least 4 contributions (pull requests) to any GitHub-hosted project between October 1 and October 31 to earn a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt!"

    "text": "We’ve got an exciting pair of talks for you this month!\n\nFirst up, Chris Hopkinson, self-described Data Lover, will be talking us through Object oriented systems in R:\n“Object Oriented programming is commonplace in many languages. It is a useful way to organise code. R has some special flavours of Object Oriented programming. Understanding these will help you understand R better and write better software.”\nThen, we have Phil Mike Jones, a geographer about to complete his PhD in computational human geography + a research associate at the Centre for Criminological Research at the School of Law,who will be discussing his journey in writing a Reproducible Thesis with Bookdown.\n“My PhD thesis is completely reproducible (except a few items that cannot be downloaded without website credentials) and this has saved me no end of headaches now I’m preparing to submit. Supervisor (or boss) asked for some changes? No problem: change the data, run the code, and sit back as all figures and calculations are automatically updated. I probably don’t need to remind you that reproducibility is also the hallmark of the scientific method.\nIn this session, I’ll share some tips that I discovered along the way and hopefully, at least some will be helpful for your projects. A completely reproducible project might not be possible or practical for you, but reproducibility is a scale so all projects could benefit from at least some of this advice.”\nHope to see you there.\nThe SheffieldR team"

She studies interactions between land-use change and climate change in the tropics. She’s going to talk about the work she’s been doing analysing thermal image data collected in the forests of Borneo.\nChris Hopkinson is a Sheffield R group regular, analyst and data lover.

She’ll talk about the challenges associated with the structure of thermal data and the kinds of questions that ecologists can ask with such data, such as capturing the extent to which animals can move locally to track their preferred temperatures. A single thermal image produces 19,200 distinct temperature measurements, so optimising the extraction -> processing -> plotting -> analysis workflow is essential."

    "text": "Using C++ to speed up R code\nR is a very handy tool for data analysis, but it can be computationally quite slow. When analysing large data sets, or using complex models, it can be desirable to speed things up. For this reason, it has become increasingly common to combine R code with C++ code. C++ is a compiled programming language, which makes it much faster than R in some cases. I will first talk about Rcpp, an R package which makes it very simple to call C++ functions from an R script. Then, I will talk about the Template Model Builder (TMB), an R package which uses automatic differentiation in C++ to speed up the numerical evaluation of a function (typically, a likelihood function), thus making techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation very fast. I will show that these do not require a strong programming background, and that it is quite easy for someone familiar with R to use Rcpp and TMB. I will compare the three approaches with examples of code.\nWe hope to see you there!\nThe SheffieldR team"

I am currently a post doc at the University of Sheffield modelling the evolution of herbicide resistance. I also use these approaches to address a wide range of topics such as population dynamics, community ecology, dispersal ecology, optimal population management, and social-economic systems. I am also interested in how far population models for one species or area can be extrapolated to others, and if so, how it should be done.\n\nLukas Drapal will introduce us to the online machine learning competition site kaggle:\n\nKaggle is a great place to learn data science by doing. Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions and has a very active community that share their techniques and tips. In this talk I describe how Kaggle works, share best practises and dive into challenges of a competition that we won among more than 1500 teams - Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at the Red Deer on 1 November!

    "text": "Writing a decision tree package for R\nDecision trees are a class of model widely used in health economic modelling. A tree (in the mathematical sense) has probabilities associated with branches leaving a node to describe the chances of a set of potential outcomes. In health economics, costs and health consequences are also associated with outcomes. By way of example, clinical diagnostic algorithms based on a sequence of symptom screens and diagnostic tests map particularly naturally into this framework. There are proprietary packages to develop, visualize and analyse such models, but nothing open-source and user-friendly. We describe an attempt to develop a package with a simple syntax for decision tree models in R based on the DOT language, which allows visualization, as well as considerable flexibility in analysis approach.\nWe hope to see you there!\nThe SheffieldR team"
