A tree (in the mathematical sense) has probabilities associated with branches leaving a node to describe the chances of a set of potential outcomes. In health economics, costs and health consequences are also associated with outcomes. By way of example, clinical diagnostic algorithms based on a sequence of symptom screens and diagnostic tests map particularly naturally into this framework. There are proprietary packages to develop, visualize and analyse such models, but nothing open-source and user-friendly. We describe an attempt to develop a package with a simple syntax for decision tree models in R based on the DOT language, which allows visualization, as well as considerable flexibility in analysis approach.\nWe hope to see you there!\nThe SheffieldR team"

    "text": "Using C++ to speed up R code\nR is a very handy tool for data analysis, but it can be computationally quite slow. When analysing large data sets, or using complex models, it can be desirable to speed things up. For this reason, it has become increasingly common to combine R code with C++ code. C++ is a compiled programming language, which makes it much faster than R in some cases. I will first talk about Rcpp, an R package which makes it very simple to call C++ functions from an R script. Then, I will talk about the Template Model Builder (TMB), an R package which uses automatic differentiation in C++ to speed up the numerical evaluation of a function (typically, a likelihood function), thus making techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation very fast. I will show that these do not require a strong programming background, and that it is quite easy for someone familiar with R to use Rcpp and TMB. I will compare the three approaches with examples of code.\nWe hope to see you there!\nThe SheffieldR team"

    "text": "Robert Smith\nLiving HTA: Automating Health Economic Evaluation with R\n\n\n\nSchematic showing the interaction between the company API (application programming interface) and the consultant automated workflow.\n\n\nBackground: Requiring access to sensitive data can be a significant obstacle for the development of health models in the Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR) setting. We demonstrate how health economic evaluation can be conducted with minimal transfer of data between parties, while automating reporting as new information becomes available.\nMethods: We developed an automated analysis and reporting pipeline for health economic modelling and made the source code openly available on a GitHub repository. The pipeline consists of three parts: An economic model is constructed by the consultant using pseudo data. On the data-owner side, an application programming interface (API) is hosted on a server. This API hosts all sensitive data, so that data does not have to be provided to the consultant. An automated workflow is created, which calls the API, retrieves results, and generates a report.\nResults : The application of modern data science tools and practices allows analyses of data without the need for direct access – negating the need to send sensitive data. In addition, the entire workflow can be largely automated: the analysis can be scheduled to run at defined time points (e.g. monthly), or when triggered by an event (e.g. an update to the underlying data or model code); results can be generated automatically and then be exported into a report. Documents no longer need to be revised manually.\nConclusions: This example demonstrates that it is possible, within a HEOR setting, to separate the health economic model from the data, and automate the main steps of the analysis pipeline.\n\nBiography - Robert Smith\nRob is a health economist based in Sheffield, UK. His research focuses on the methods used to estimate the costs and benefits of public health interventions, with a specific interest in microsimulation modelling in R. He is a expert advisor in Public Health Economics & Decision Science to the WHO-HEAT project. He is currently working at the Joint Biosecurity Centre to help inform the UK government response to the pandemic."

However, there is limited guidance on how to best develop models using R. So far, no clear consensus has emerged.\nMethods: We present the advantages of creating health economic models as R packages - structured collections of functions, data sets, tests, and documentation. Assuming an intermediate understanding of R, we provide a tutorial to demonstrate how to construct a basic R package for health economic evaluation. All source code used in or referenced by this paper is available under an open-source licence.\nCase Study: We use the Sick Sicker Model as a case study applying the steps from the tutorial to standardise model development, documentation and aid review. This can improve the distribution of code, thereby streamlining model development, and improving methods in health economic evaluation.\nConclusion: R packages offer a valuable framework for enhancing the quality and transparency of health economic evaluation models. Embracing better, more standardised software development practices, while fostering a collaborative culture, has the potential to significantly improve the quality of health economic models, and, ultimately, support better decision making in healthcare.\n\nBiography - Wael Mohammed\nWael is a health economist with a background in pharmacy and public health. In addition, he has experience in decision-analytic modelling, econometrics, and data science. He is currently pursuing a PhD in public health, economics and decision science at the University of Sheffield."

They would like to be able to integrate it with biodiversity data from the NBN to facilitate further analysis. So the aim of this project is to produce a simple shiny app through which the user can select species/taxa of interest, query the NBN for data and match it to spatial polygon data. The app would then output an analytical dataset that could then be used for further analysis. Outputs could therefore feed into the spatial analysis project.\nRepository link: Habitats vs Biodiversity\n\n\nHumans vs Biodiversity\nThis team sought to determine how Sheffield’s biodiversity had changed with Sheffield’s population. As Sheffield’s urban environments grow with the population, the team wanted to understand how local wildlife had changed over time. The team looked into measures that could be used to estimate population density, river quality from other open data sources alongside an estimate for biodiversity in the data from the NBN gateway.\nRepository link: Humans vs Biodiversity\n\n\nTeam Temporal\nTeam Temporal wanted to study how species were represented in the NBN Gateway data sets over time. The team aimed to build plots of records over time for species with more than 1000 records in the data set. Additionally, the team sought to apply Telfer’s change index to produce a summary of the change over time for species in Sheffield.\nRepository link: Team Temporal\n\n\nBird Bingo\nBird Bingo is a game where players are given a virtual “card” with pictures of several species they might see in their area. When they see one of their species they can check it off. The team used the NBN Gateway to get species the user was likely to see by querying the Gateway for local species in the bird TVK species group. The team used the Encyclopedia of Life’s API to get images for the selected species and presented the player’s card and handled checking off species using the Shiny web framework.\nRepository link: BirdBingo\n\n\nTeam Python\nThis team wrote an NBN Gateway package for Python a la rnbn.\nRepository link: lionfish0/pynbn\nSee the Hack details page for details on the event including how to register.

    "title": "October Sheffield R Meetup: Git, GitHub, and Shiny apps",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This month we will be taking a look at integrating git and github use with R. Git is a great tool to help you manage your code using version control - helping avoid that annoying situation where you have 8 different pieces of code and can’t remember which one you should be using! Github then allows you to share your code and documentation, which can be a great way to disseminate your work and help others to reproduce it (as per the philosophy of open science). We also plan on using it in the upcoming Biodiversity hack event! Feel free to bring your laptops along if you want to dabble as we go!\nAlso, Anna Krystalli is going to demonstrate a great example of a Shiny app which she has built, allowing easy visualisation and tabulation of data from a large database of bird species.\nFinally - for those of you interested in participating in the Biodiversity hack early next year, we would be really happy if you could fill in this very short survey. This info will help us to plan when and how the event will be structured - this doesn’t commit you to attending.\nMaterial from the Git workshop is available on GitHub: {% include icon-github.html username=“mathew-hall” %} / SheffieldR. During the session, some attendees made their own pull requests to our workshop repository. Code for Anna’s Shiny app is available on her GitHub page at {% include icon-github.html username=“annakrystalli” %} / birds."

    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nSheffield LSOAs\n\n\nJoin us for an exciting showcase where we’ll dive into two innovative R-Shiny projects. The first project introduces the fascinating world of mapping to investigate the dynamics of segregation among neighboring regions, a concept we fondly refer to as “social frontiers.” In the second project, we explore economic sectors with a focus on aiding South Yorkshire’s mayoral authority in their strategic growth planning endeavours.\nThe burning question that currently occupies our minds: How can we leverage powerful tools like Shiny to assist other institutions, including local councils and mayoral offices, in streamlining their data analysis processes and preventing unnecessary duplication of effort? Be a part of this engaging exploration and discover how Shiny can be a game-changer in data analysis for various institutions. Don’t miss this opportunity to be part of the conversation and gain valuable insights into the future of data-driven decision-making.\n\nBiography\nDr Dan Olner is a policy fellow with Y-PERN, the Yorkshire Policy Engagement and Research Network, working closely with SMYCA in their business, growth and skills team on all things spatial, data and regional. His background is in spatial analysis, spatial economics, data science and politics. He has an interest in using data analysis to address sustainability and net zero issues.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We’ve got an exciting pair of talks for you this month!\n\nFirst up, Chris Hopkinson, self-described Data Lover, will be talking us through Object oriented systems in R:\n“Object Oriented programming is commonplace in many languages. It is a useful way to organise code. R has some special flavours of Object Oriented programming. Understanding these will help you understand R better and write better software.”\nThen, we have Phil Mike Jones, a geographer about to complete his PhD in computational human geography + a research associate at the Centre for Criminological Research at the School of Law,who will be discussing his journey in writing a Reproducible Thesis with Bookdown.\n“My PhD thesis is completely reproducible (except a few items that cannot be downloaded without website credentials) and this has saved me no end of headaches now I’m preparing to submit. Supervisor (or boss) asked for some changes? No problem: change the data, run the code, and sit back as all figures and calculations are automatically updated. I probably don’t need to remind you that reproducibility is also the hallmark of the scientific method.\nIn this session, I’ll share some tips that I discovered along the way and hopefully, at least some will be helpful for your projects. A completely reproducible project might not be possible or practical for you, but reproducibility is a scale so all projects could benefit from at least some of this advice.”\nHope to see you there.\nThe SheffieldR team"
